    Description: A module to handle FNBO data.  Uses u2py functionality
    
    Files:
        FNBO.XREF
        
    Notes:
    This works only when U2 has a python license.  It also only works from a 
    command line and in the correct directory.
    For example, if I have a UniVerse account set up as
    /usr/local/madev
    And in this directory I have a source directory:
    rdlpy
    From a command line, in the /usr/local/madev directory I can do
        /usr/uv/python/bin/python3
    Which puts me at a python command prompt:
        >>>
    Then:    
        >>> from rdlpy import fnbo
        >>> fnbo.findByArn(fnbo.textArn)
        >>>
